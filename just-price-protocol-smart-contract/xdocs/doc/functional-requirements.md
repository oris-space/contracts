# Just Price Protocol Smart Contract: Functional Requirements

This document describes functional requirements for Just Price Protocol smart contract: Ethereum smart contract that acts as a market maker for Orgon tokens.

## 1. Introduction

Just Price Protocol Smart Contract is an Ethereum smart contract that buys and sells Orgon tokens according to rules coded into the contract.
Tokens are issued right before being sold by Just Price Protocol Smart Contract and are burned right after there were bought by it.
It also holds ether reserve that guarantees value of Orgon tokens.
When Just Price Protocol Smart Contract sells tokens, it adds revenue to the reserve.
When it buys tokens, it pays from the reserve.
During its life span Just Price Protocol Smart Contract goes through several stages, and functionality of Just Price Protocol Smart Contract greatly depends of current stage.
The following sections describe stages, transitions between them and main use cases.
Related use cases are grouped into functional blocks.

## 2. Stages

This section describes all stages Just Price Protocol Smart Contract may go through during its life span as well as all valid transitions between them.
Here is stages diagram:

### 2.1. BEFORE_RESERVE Stage

##### Description:

This stage lasts from the deployment of Just Price Protocol Smart Contract till sale start.
In case smart contract is deployed after sale start, this stage is skipped.
During this stage tokens may not be bought nor sold.

##### Transitions:

* To RESERVE stage: when sale start time is reached

### 2.2. RESERVE Stage

##### Description:

This stage lasts from sale start time till the moment 72500 ETH is collected or till reserve deadline, whichever comes first.
In case smart contract is deployed after reserve deadline, this stage is skipped.
In case RESERVE stage ended by reaching deadline, number of tokens in circulation is reduced to maintain reserve / tokens count ratio to be equal to 0.0001 ETH per whole token.
Number of tokens is reduced by burning some tokens belonging to Oris Space.
During this stage tokens may be bought from the smart contract but not sold to it.
Once bought, tokens are not delivered to the buyer immediately, but delivery is postponed until the end of RESERVE stage.
Token price depends on how may ETH is collected in reserve according to the following table:

ETH collected  | Token price (ETH per token)
---------------|----------------------------
0 .. 10000     | 0.00080
10000 .. 20000 | 0.00082
20000 .. 30000 | 0.00085
30000 .. 40000 | 0.00088
40000 .. 50000 | 0.00090
50000 .. 60000 | 0.00092
60000 .. 70000 | 0.00095
70000 .. 72500 | 0.00098

In case single purchase crosses price boundary, two or more prices are applied to corresponding parts.
Let's consider an example.
There is 37000 ETH already collected in reserve.
Alice wants to buy tokens for 15000 ETH, but there is only 3000 ETH to be collected till price change.
So, three prices will be applied in a sequence like shown in the following table:

Alice's ETH remaining | ETH in reserve       | ETH till next price  | Price   | Tokens (9 decimals) | ETH spent
----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|---------|---------------------|--------------------
15000                 | 37000                | 3000                 | 0.00088 | 3409090.909090909   | 2999.99999999999992
12000.00000000000008  | 39999.99999999999992 | 10000.00000000000008 | 0.00090 | 11111111.111111111  | 9999.9999999999999
2000.00000000000018   | 49999.99999999999982 | 10000.00000000000018 | 0.00092 | 2173913.043478261   | 2000.00000000000012

So Alice will buy 16694115.063680281 tokens and will get 0.00000000000006 unspent ether back.

If purchase crosses reserve target of 72500 ETH, then unspent ether is returned to the buyer.

##### Transitions:

* To BEFORE_GROWTH stage: when amount of collected ether is so big that it is impossible to buy another token unit without crossing hard cap of 72500 ETH.
* To BEFORE_GROWTH stage: when reserve deadline is reached and at least 39013.174672 ETH collected.
* To REFUND stage: when reserve deadline is reached and less than 39013.174672 ETH collected.

### 2.3. BEFORE_GROWTH Stage

##### Description:

This stage lasts from the end of successful RESERVE stage (i.e. RESERVE stage that was able to collect at least 39013.174672 ETH) till the moment when at least 80% of tokens bought during RESERVE stage are delivered to their corresponding buyers.
During this stage tokens may not be bought nor sold.

#### Transitions:

* To GROWTH stage: when at least 80% of tokens bought during RESERVE state are delivered to their corresponding buyers.

### 2.4. GROWTH Stage

##### Description:

This stage lasts from the end of BEFORE_GROWTH stage till the moment when there will be at least 1,500,000,000 tokens in circulation, but not longer than for one year.
During this stage tokens may be bought from the smart contract but not sold to it.
Number of tokens to be bought for given amount of ether is calculated individually for each purchase via the following formula:

    T ((1 + e/E)^0.1 - 1)

Here `T` is current number of tokens in circulation, `E` is amount of ether in reserve, and `e` is an amount of ether buyer wants to buy tokens for.
For every purchase, small fraction of purchased tokens is withheld by Just Price Protocol smart contract and sent to special address, known as K1.

##### Transitions:

* To LIFE stage: when there are at least 1,000,000,000 tokens in circulation
* To LIFE stage: when 285 days passed since the start of GROWTH stage

### 2.5. LIFE Stage

##### Description:

This stage lasts from the end of GROWTH stage.
During this stage tokens may be both, bought from the smart contract and sold to it.
Buying from the smart contract works exactly as during GROWTH phase.
Amount of ether to be payed for given number of tokens sold to the smart contract if calculated individually for each sell via the following formula:

    E (1 - (1 - t/T)^10)

Here `E` is amount of ether in reserve, `t` it number of tokens seller wants to sell and `T` is current number of tokens in circulation.

##### Transitions:

None

## 7. Transition Use Cases

This section contains use cases that are executed by _Smart Contract_ automatically when it goes from one stage to another.
For transitions that are triggered by reaching certain deadline, corresponding transition use case is executed in a lazy way right before any use case whose behavior depends on current smart contract stage.
For transitions that are triggered by executing some method on smart contract, corresponding transition use case is executed right after the use implemented by the method that was called.
